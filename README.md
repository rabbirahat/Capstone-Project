Our study is going to detect and classify garbage. Moreover, it will notify the authorities after detecting garbage using an alarming sound. The system uses an algorithm to classify garbage into two different categories: “plastic bottles” and “chips packet". To execute object detection, the YOLOv4-tiny algorithm is selected as the main neural network framework. A dataset of garbage photos obtained from multiple sources is used to train YOLOv4-tiny, and a different test dataset is used to evaluate its accuracy.
